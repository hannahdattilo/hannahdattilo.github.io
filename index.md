# about 

Hello! My name is Hannah Dattilo and I am a second year PhD Electrical Engineering student at Vanderbilt University working with Dr. Robert Reed. I received my B.S in Physics from Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, GA and my M.S. in Physics from Fisk University in Nashville, TN through the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to-PhD Bridge progam. 

# research
The interstellar void we call space and often seek to understand is not a harmless beauty that houses our universe; it is, in fact, an extremely harsh radiation environment. This means there are high energy photons, particles, and heavy ions zipping through space, and to interact with thse kinds of radiation can be damaging to the instruments we send to space (in addition to, of course, the people we send to space if we're not careful, but that's biology related and none of my business). My field of study is concerned with the effects of space radiation on photonic devices.
